## Features

- Classic Snake gameplay experience.
- Smooth rendering using SVG with D3.
- TypeScript for type-safe development.
- Yarn for dependency management.
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality.

## Acknowledgements

- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) - Data-Driven Documents library for SVG rendering.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typed JavaScript at Any Scale.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - Fast, reliable, and secure dependency management.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - Pluggable JavaScript linter.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Opinionated code formatter.

## Known Bugs

- When a player starts spamming the Spacebar button, the snake's speed will increase exponentially while the menu is open.   
I'm suspecting it's from the event listener and it just can't execute everything on time.

Enjoy playing the game! üêçüéÆ
